Sample Rails 3.2.x application for [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec: A Practical Approach to Test-driven Development](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) by Aaron Sumner. This repository demonstrates incremental testing of an existing application, starting with an untested codebase and working through model, controller, and feature specs.

Each chapter's progress has a specific branch in this repository:

- `01_untested`: The initial, untested application.
- `02_setup`: Installation and configuration of the testing tools.
- `03_models`: Basics of model specs.
- `04_factories`: Use of factories to simplify test data creation.
- `06_controllers`: Basics of controller specs.
- `07_controller_cleanup`: Refactoring of controller specs.
- `08_features`: Use of Capybara in RSpec feature specs.
- `09_speedup`: Techniques of running specs more quickly.

Using Git, you can check out each version by name; for example:

    git checkout 03_models

If you're not comfortable with Git, you can also use GitHub's handy branch/tag filter to select a specific tag and browse the source code online. To learn more about Git, I recommend [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).
